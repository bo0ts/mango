Mango v1.0b
===========

The Mango simulation framework is:
  * cross platform (Linux, OSX, Windows)
  * open source, under the MIT license

With Mango you
  * move things around in three dimensional space
  * subclass and override methods to implement custom behavior/graphics

It rocks because
  * setup is easy
  * simulations are in Python or C++, or both
  * boilerplate code is minimal
  * the only Python code running is that in overridden events
  * modular design encourages extension and reuse

See the documentation included in the *doc/* folder for more
