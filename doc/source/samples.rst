Samples
=======

Mango comes with several sample scripts, which can be found at the
following locations:
 
  **Linux**
    */opt/mango/1.0/sample/*

  **OSX**
    */Library/Frameworks/Mango.framework/Versions/Current/sample/*

  **Windows**
    *C:\\Program Files\\Mango\\1.0\\sample\\*

  .. note::
  
     On Windows, samples can also be accessed from the Start Menu
     entry titled "Mango-<version>"

These can be run using the following commands, which use the script
*profusion_of_spheres.py* as an example:

  **Linux**
    .. code-block:: bash
    
       $ mango /opt/mango/1.0/sample/profusion_of_spheres.py

  **OSX**
    Right click the script of interest and select *Open With > Mango
    Launcher*. Alternatively, open a Terminal window and execute:

    .. code-block:: bash
     
       $ mango /Library/Frameworks/Mango.framework/Versions/Current/sample/profusion_of_spheres.py			 

  **Windows** 
    Right click the script of interest and select *Run with
    Mango* from the context menu (or *Open With > Mango*)
