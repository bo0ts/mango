Setup
=====

The basic Mango setup will allow you to run simulations written in
Python, and on OSX and Windows it is very simple to install - simply
run the installer provided for your platform (installing Python is not
necessary). On Linux one must build Mango from source.

If you wish to build simulations in C++, extend Mango in C++ or embed Mango
into your application there are several additional components that must
be installed. Instructions are provided for Linux, OSX and Windows.
