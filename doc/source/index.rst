Mango 
=====

Mango is a cross-platform, scriptable, event-driven simulation framework. 

Simulations can be scripted in Python for rapid development and
evolution of ideas.

Simulations can also be built in C++ for speed and integration into
other applications.

Mango has parallel APIs: prototype in Python and then move to C++ when
greater performance is needed. Alternatively, Python-based simulations
can call into extensions written in C++.
