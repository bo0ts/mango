Mango Documentation
=================================

Mango is a cross-platform, scriptable, event-driven simulation framework. It comes 
in two flavors: Mango in Python, and Mango in C++. If you are looking to rapidly
put together a simulation, try :doc:`mangoinpython`. On the other hand, if you 
require greater performance, wish to extend Mango or embed it in your own C++ 
application, try :doc:`mangoincpp`.
