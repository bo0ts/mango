Mango 
=====

Mango is a cross-platform, scriptable, event-driven simulation framework. 

Mango comes in two flavors: Mango in Python, and Mango in C++. If you are 
looking to rapidly put together a simulation, try :doc:`mangoinpython`. On 
the other hand, if you require greater performance, wish to extend Mango or 
embed it in your own C++ application, try :doc:`mangoincpp`.
