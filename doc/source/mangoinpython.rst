Development in Python
=====================

Once Mango is set up (see :doc:`/setup`), arm yourself with your
favorite editor and you are ready to start. Although any text editor
will do, one intended for development is better (`Notepad++
<http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ on Windows or `gedit
<http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/>`_ on OSX are good choices).
