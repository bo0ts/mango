Building From Source
====================

Building Mango from source is part of the installation procedure for
Linux, but it may be desirable on other platforms in order to build a
modified version or port. Instructions are provided for each platform,
and assume dependencies are installed at their default locations as
described in the respective setup pages (see :doc:`setup`) - in the
event that a dependency is installed at a different location, small
adjustments to the instructions may be necessary.
